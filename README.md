PROJECT: Build the Google.com homepage

This is the first project that I used to get my feet wet with HTML/CSS!

I enjoyed this project because I learned a lot about the process of coding and its various ups and downs.

I learned that it can be challenging to keep your code organized.

I got comfortable using various selectors.

I learned what some of my more prominent weaknesses are (note to self: watch some Youtube videos on flexboxes).

Overall it felt great to put the concepts I'd been learning into practice, and to have some more direction on what to go back and study more. I am looking forward to learning more, honing my skills a bit, and revising this project to reflect a higher skill level in the future. I would like to improve the responsiveness of this webpage and master the positioning of my elements.

Thanks for taking the time to read!
